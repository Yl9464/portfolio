      <p class="hobbieName">🐾 Everything Dog 🐾</p>
      <p class="hobbieText">I have been an avid dog lover my whole life. I have worked in a varity of roles in the K-9 world throughout my life- as a dog walker/sitter, vetrinarian assistant, play date supervisor, and trainer.
        Whether I am playing with my own dog, training a client's dog, or hanging out with a pack of crazy pups I'm always happiest when I'm engulfed by my 4-legged friends!

      <p class="hobbieText"> Hiking is one of my favorite activities. My last hike was in New Hampshire at Mount Monadnock,
        the view was amazing and I hope to do more hikes like that again soon. One of the things on my bucket lists is to hike
        the entire Appalachian trail some day.</p>

      <p class="hobbieText">Growing up I was a great biker, I spent my summer days biking the Cape Cod Rail Trail from  Welfleet to Dennis MA, and back. I really enjoyed those 50ish miles a day, surrounds
        by beautiful weather and had a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. I don't think I could ever bike that distance again, but had a great time as a teenager. Another bucket list item is to
      bike the PMC.</p>
