    <p class="hobbieName">🐾 Everything Dog 🐾</p>
    <p class="hobbieText">I have been an avid dog lover my whole life. I have worked in a varity of roles in the K-9 world throughout my life- as a dog walker/sitter, vetrinarian assistant, play date supervisor, and trainer.
      Whether I am playing with my own dog, training a client's dog, or hanging out with a pack of crazy pups I'm always happiest when I'm engulfed by my 4-legged friends!

    <p class="hobbieName">🥾 Hiking 🥾</p>
    <p class="hobbieText"> Hiking is one of my favorite activities. My last hike was in New Hampshire at Mount Monadnock,
      the view was amazing and I hope to do more hikes like that again soon. One of the things on my bucket lists is to hike
      the entire Appalachian trail some day.</p>

  <div class="container bike">
    <p class="hobbieName">🚲 Biking🚲</p>
    <p class="hobbieText">Growing I spent my summer days biking the Cape Cod Rail Trail from Welfleet to Dennis MA, and back. I enjoyed those 50ish miles a day, surrounded
      by beautiful weather and had a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. I don't think I could ever bike that distance again, but I still enjoy it and had a great
      time as a teenager</p>
